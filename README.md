# Past and Present

A Next.js e-commerce site for vintage and modern treasures, built using components from the Riverside Herald project.

## Feature Breakdown

## Articles Page

The articles page (`/articles`) supports:

- **Search**: Form submits to `?search=<query>`. Preserves category when searching.
- **Empty state**: "No articles match your filters" when filtered; "Clear filters" link.

Articles are fetched from `/news/articles/` with `status=published`, `category`, and `search` params.

## Product Data: SKU

- **SKU** is an optional field on each product. Store owners enter it when creating/editing products in the Product Form.
- SKU is stored in the database, shown in admin inventory and product detail pages, and included in CSV export.
- **Yoco does not use SKU** — the payment integration sends only the order total to Yoco, not line items or SKUs. SKU is for internal record-keeping and order history (OrderItem.product_sku).

## Backend Requirements

This site connects to the Django CRM backend. Ensure:

1. Company `past-and-present` is registered in the backend
2. Products are created with `is_vintage` flag for categorization
3. Articles are created for content pages (home, about, etc.)
4. Yoco integration is configured for payments
5. Courier Guy credentials (optional) for Pudo locations and shipment creation
